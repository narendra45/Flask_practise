How to Build RESTful APIs with Python and Flask
Published Jan 05, 2018Last updated Jan 16, 2020
For some time now I have been working with Python but I just got to try out Flask recently, so I felt it would be nice to write about it. In this aritcle I'll discuss about Flask and how you can use it to build RESTfull APIs.

Flask is a Python-based microframework that enables you to quickly build web applications; the ‚Äúmicro‚Äù in microframework simply means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible.

What is REST?
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style, and an approach to communications that is often used in the development of Web services.

REST web services are a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant Web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations.

This guide will walk you through building a Restful APi with Flask coupled with other extensions - Flask-RESTful, flask_migrate, marshmallow etc. At the end, you'll build a simple Commenting API. The API will have endpoints that can be used to add category, view categories, update category, delete category, add comments and view comments.

Flask does not come out of the box with all the extension needed to buld a full fledge API. However there are lot's of extension that can be pluged into Flask to enable you build awesome APIs.

At the end of this guide, you should have this API endpoints available:

GET - /api/Category - Retrieve all categories

POST - /api/Category - Add a new category

PUT - /api/Category - Update a category

DELETE - /api/Category - Delete a category

GET - /api/Comment - Retrieve all the stored comments

POST - /api/Comment - Add new comment

Before You Begin
Make sure you have Python3.x installed on your system.

We'll use PostgreSQL database for this tutorial. Install Postgres database if you don't have it installed already.

Make sure virtualenv is installed on your system.

Step 0: Setting up the application
First, create the structure of the app at any location on your system:
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrate.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Model.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Hello.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run.py
If you prefer the command line to create the folders and files, you can use the below command:

# Create folders
$ mkdir project && cd project && mkdir resources

# Create files
$ touch app.py migrate.py Model.py requirements.txt run.py config.py && cd resources && touch Hello.py && cd ../
Then open up your terminal and CD (change directory) into the app root folder - project.

Next, create and activate a virtual environment.

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

Creates virtual environment

$ python3.6 -m venv env
OR:

$ python -m venv env
The command to use depends on which associates with your python3 installation.

Activates the virtual environment

$ source env/bin/activate
Add the folowing extensions to requirements.txt:

flask==0.12.2
flask_restful==0.3.6
flask_script==2.0.6
flask_migrate==2.1.1
marshmallow==2.14.0
flask_sqlalchemy==2.3.2
flask_marshmallow==0.8.0
marshmallow-sqlalchemy==0.13.2
psycopg2==2.7.5
The above file contains all python extensions our API will use.

flask - This is a microframework for Python

flask_restful - This is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building of REST APIs.

flask_script - This is an extension that provides support for writing external scripts in Flask.

flask_migrate - This is an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

marshmallow - This is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes. We'll use this for validation. This is used to Serializing and Deserializing Objects.

flask_sqlalchemy - This is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy.

flask_marshmallow - This is an ntegration layer for Flask and marshmallow (an object serialization/deserialization library) that adds additional features to marshmallow.

marshmallow-sqlalchemy - This adds additional features to marshmallow.

psycopg - This is a PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language.

Step 1: Install all dependencies:
From your terminal, make sure you are in the root folder of the project then run the below command:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
This will download and install all the extensions in requirements.txt.

Step 2: Setting up configuration
Add the following code to config.py:

import os

# You need to replace the next values with the appropriate values for your configuration

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "postgresql://username:password@localhost/database_name"
Here, we have defined some configuration that the API will be using. We are also using the PostgreSQL database. If you prefer other databases, you just have to modify the value accordingly.

Example: if you want to use SQLite, you should modify this line as:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///app.db"
 
Make sure you change the above settings with the appropriate values for your configuration. Change the username and password to your correct database credentials.

Step 3: Create the API entry points
Add the following code to app.py:

from flask import Blueprint
from flask_restful import Api
from resources.Hello import Hello

api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__)
api = Api(api_bp)

# Route
api.add_resource(Hello, '/Hello')
Here we imported Blueprint from flask, and also Api from flask_restful. The imported Api will add some functionality to flask which will help us to add routes and simplify some processes.

api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__) - creates a Blueprint which we'll register to the app later.

api.add_resource(Hello, '/Hello') - creates a route - /Hello. add_resource accepts two parameter - Hello and /Hello, where Hello is the class we have imported and /Hello is the route we defined for that Resource.

Now let's create the Hello class we mentioned above. Add the following code to - resources/Hello.py:

from flask_restful import Resource


class Hello(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
In the Hello class, we defined a function - get. This means that any GET Request on the /Hello endpoint will be hitting this function.

So if you need a POST method, you will have something like:

    def post(self):
        return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
Finally, add the following code to run.py:

from flask import Flask

def create_app(config_filename):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(config_filename)
    
    from app import api_bp
    app.register_blueprint(api_bp, url_prefix='/api')

    from Model import db
    db.init_app(app)

    return app


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = create_app("config")
    app.run(debug=True)
Step 4: Starting the Server
From your terminal, make sure you are on the root folder of the app then run this command:

$ python run.py
If everything goes fine at this point, you should have an output like the below:

 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 136-695-873
Now, Visit the URL(http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Hello), you should see an output as below:

{
    "hello": "world"
}
Awesome! üòÑ

Step 5: Creating Models.
Up next is to write our models. Flask provides developers with the power and flexibility of the SQL Alchemy ORM to manage and query the application data. ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper, it is a tool that allows developers to store and retrieve data using object oriented approaches and solves the object-relational impedance mismatch.

Also, Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that provides support for SQLAlchemy ORM in the Flask framework.

In the - Model.py file, add the following code to it:

from flask import Flask
from marshmallow import Schema, fields, pre_load, validate
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy


ma = Marshmallow()
db = SQLAlchemy()


class Comment(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'comments'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    comment = db.Column(db.String(250), nullable=False)
    creation_date = db.Column(db.TIMESTAMP, server_default=db.func.current_timestamp(), nullable=False)
    category_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('categories.id', ondelete='CASCADE'), nullable=False)
    category = db.relationship('Category', backref=db.backref('comments', lazy='dynamic' ))

    def __init__(self, comment, category_id):
        self.comment = comment
        self.category_id = category_id


class Category(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'categories'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


class CategorySchema(ma.Schema):
    id = fields.Integer()
    name = fields.String(required=True)


class CommentSchema(ma.Schema):
    id = fields.Integer(dump_only=True)
    category_id = fields.Integer(required=True)
    comment = fields.String(required=True, validate=validate.Length(1))
    creation_date = fields.DateTime()
Here, we have two models - Comment and Category class. These Class defines our table structure.
__tablename__ = 'categories' is used to declare the table name associated with that Model.

We've also defined columns for our table using eg:

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(150), unique=True, nullable=False)
The id and name are the columns for the table and the the value after the = defines column structure. You can read more on creating table schema here

Moving on, the CategorySchema and CommentSchema are used for validation. Here, we defined some rules (eg: required=True). You can read more here

Step 6: Running migrations
In the migrate.py file add the following code to it:

from flask_script import Manager
from flask_migrate import Migrate, MigrateCommand
from Model import db
from run import create_app

app = create_app('config')

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
manager = Manager(app)
manager.add_command('db', MigrateCommand)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    manager.run()
In the code above, we created a command for running migration from our command prompt.

Migrations
Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to easily modify and share the application's database schema. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve. In this tutorial, we are using a flask extension - flask migrate to acheive this.

Run migrations initialization, using the db init command as follows:
  $ python migrate.py db init
Creating directory /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations ... done
  Creating directory /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/versions ... done
  Generating /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/alembic.ini ... done
  Generating /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/README ... done
  Generating /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/env.py ... done
  Generating /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/script.py.mako ... done
  Please edit configuration/connection/logging settings in '/home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/alembic.ini' before
  proceeding.
The script also generated a new migrations sub-folder within the folder with a versions subfolder and many other files.

Run the second script that populates the migration script with the detected changes in the
models. In this case, it is the first time we populate the migration script, and therefore, the
migration script will generate the tables that will persist our two models: Category and Comment:

Run the migration:

$ python migrate.py db migrate
 
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'category'
INFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'comment'
  Generating /home/user/Desktop/pylinone/migrations/versions/015c8b601c6b_.py ... done
Then apply the migration to the database. Run the upgrade command:

Run the upgrade command:
    python migrate.py db upgrade

INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 015c8b601c6b, empty message
Each time the database models change repeat the migrate and upgrade commands.

Step 7: Adding Category resources
Create a new file resources/Category.py. This will take care of all Category related Logic. Add the below code to resources/Category.py:

from flask import request
from flask_restful import Resource
from Model import db, Category, CategorySchema

categories_schema = CategorySchema(many=True)
category_schema = CategorySchema()

class CategoryResource(Resource):
    def get(self):
        categories = Category.query.all()
        categories = categories_schema.dump(categories).data
        return {'status': 'success', 'data': categories}, 200
Here, we have created a get method for fetching categories. We now have a new endpoint - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Category.

Using Category.query.all(), we fetched all categories in the database and using categories_schema.dump(categories).data, we deserialized the data fetched.

Next, lets add a POST method for creating new category. Add the following code to resources/Category.py:

...
    def post(self):
        json_data = request.get_json(force=True)
        if not json_data:
               return {'message': 'No input data provided'}, 400
        # Validate and deserialize input
        data, errors = category_schema.load(json_data)
        if errors:
            return errors, 422
        category = Category.query.filter_by(name=data['name']).first()
        if category:
            return {'message': 'Category already exists'}, 400
        category = Category(
            name=json_data['name']
            )

        db.session.add(category)
        db.session.commit()

        result = category_schema.dump(category).data

        return { "status": 'success', 'data': result }, 201
Next, lets add a PUT method for updating category. Update resources/Category.py as below:

...
    def put(self):
        json_data = request.get_json(force=True)
        if not json_data:
               return {'message': 'No input data provided'}, 400
        # Validate and deserialize input
        data, errors = category_schema.load(json_data)
        if errors:
            return errors, 422
        category = Category.query.filter_by(id=data['id']).first()
        if not category:
            return {'message': 'Category does not exist'}, 400
        category.name = data['name']
        db.session.commit()

        result = category_schema.dump(category).data

        return { "status": 'success', 'data': result }, 204
Finally, lets add a DELETE method for deleting category. Add the following code to resources/Category.py:

...
    def delete(self):
        json_data = request.get_json(force=True)
        if not json_data:
               return {'message': 'No input data provided'}, 400
        # Validate and deserialize input
        data, errors = category_schema.load(json_data)
        if errors:
            return errors, 422
        category = Category.query.filter_by(id=data['id']).delete()
        db.session.commit()

        result = category_schema.dump(category).data

        return { "status": 'success', 'data': result}, 204
Finally, import these resources to app.py. Update app.py exactly as below:

from flask import Blueprint
from flask_restful import Api
from resources.Hello import Hello
from resources.Category import CategoryResource


api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__)
api = Api(api_bp)

# Routes

api.add_resource(Hello, '/Hello')
api.add_resource(CategoryResource, '/Category')
In the Category resources, we have creating 4 endpoints:

GET - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Category

POST - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Category

PUT - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Category

DELETE - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/Category

Step 8: Adding Comment resources
Create a new file resources/Comment.py. This will take care of all Comments related Logic.

from flask import jsonify, request
from flask_restful import Resource
from Model import db, Comment, Category, CommentSchema

comments_schema = CommentSchema(many=True)
comment_schema = CommentSchema()

class CommentResource(Resource):
    def get(self):
        comments = Comment.query.all()
        comments = comments_schema.dump(comments).data
        return {"status":"success", "data":comments}, 200

    def post(self):
        json_data = request.get_json(force=True)
        if not json_data:
               return {'message': 'No input data provided'}, 400
        # Validate and deserialize input
        data, errors = comment_schema.load(json_data)
        if errors:
            return {"status": "error", "data": errors}, 422
        category_id = Category.query.filter_by(id=data['category_id']).first()
        if not category_id:
            return {'status': 'error', 'message': 'comment category not found'}, 4

# Routes

api.add_resource(Hello, '/Hello')
api.add_resource(CategoryResource, '/Category')
api.add_resource(CommentResource, '/Comment')
Step 9: Test Enpoints
We now have the following endpoints available:

POST - http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/category - for adding categories.
