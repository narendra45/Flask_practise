Routing
Modern web applications use meaningful URLs to help users. Users are more likely to like a page and come back if the page uses a meaningful URL they can remember and use to directly visit a page.

Use the route() decorator to bind a function to a URL.

URL Building
To build a URL to a specific function, use the url_for() function. It accepts the name of the function as its first argument and any number of keyword arguments, each corresponding to a variable part of the URL rule. Unknown variable parts are appended to the URL as query parameters.

Why would you want to build URLs using the URL reversing function url_for() instead of hard-coding them into your templates?

Reversing is often more descriptive than hard-coding the URLs.

You can change your URLs in one go instead of needing to remember to manually change hard-coded URLs.

URL building handles escaping of special characters and Unicode data transparently.

The generated paths are always absolute, avoiding unexpected behavior of relative paths in browsers.

If your application is placed outside the URL root, for example, in /myapplication instead of /, url_for() properly handles that for you.

For example, here we use the test_request_context() method to try out url_for(). test_request_context() tells Flask to behave as though it’s handling a request even while we use a Python shell. See Context Locals.

from flask import Flask, url_for
from markupsafe import escape

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'index'

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    return 'login'

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def profile(username):
    return '{}\'s profile'.format(escape(username))

with app.test_request_context():
    print(url_for('index'))
    print(url_for('login'))
    print(url_for('login', next='/'))
    print(url_for('profile', username='John Doe'))
/
/login
/login?next=/
/user/John%20Doe

A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application, they are registered with a blueprint. Then the blueprint is registered with the application when it is available in the factory function.
Flaskr will have two blueprints, one for authentication functions and one for the blog posts functions. The code for each blueprint will go in a separate module. Since the blog needs to know about authentication, you’ll write the authentication one first.
